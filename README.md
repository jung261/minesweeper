This is one of the projects I had to complete for CGT 45600 - Advanced Web Programming, Development, and Data Integration.

CGT 456 focuses on demonstrating the understanding of ASP.NET, C#, and the .NET Framework, creating and compiling advanced dynamic web projects using ASP.NET technology, and demonstrating understanding of advanced database applications and SQL.



Project 2: Create Your Own Game
Using the skills you have developed in the previous assignment, combined with the extensive use of event handlers and control manipulation, create your own game for project two. I would be fine with everybody creating Simon for Project 2; however, I want to give you the flexibility to create what you want. Just don't make the project so large that you cause yourself problems with finishing it. Here is a montage of previous games created in this class:

There are not many stipulations on this project, but it does need to be at least as complex and as lengthy code-wise as the Memory Match assignment (roughly, I'm not counting lines of code). It cannot be a card matching game - You must choose something different. Here are some ideas:

Simon (where you have the game highlight the colors and the user has to do the same pattern)
Sliding Tile Puzzle (where you have one blank square and you click the neighboring tiles to move them around until you get all the tiles in order)
Connect 4 (where you alternate user/computer dropping a colored coin until one of you has 4 in a row, up, down, or diagonal)
Tic Tac Toe (pretty simple game, I would probably prefer you do one of the above games)
Card games (be careful, these may look attractive to make, but can be very coding intensive)
Blackjack, Hearts, Slap Jack, Go Fish, Solitaire, Poker games, etc
Don't over-extend yourself on your choice of game. You've been warned. 

The game can be done as a WPF app (.NET Framework) using C# (which you may want to do since that's what you are most familiar with right now) or as a web page aspx using C#. Those are the only two ways that the project will be accepted. Full project code must be turned in. I must be able to load your project in Visual Studio and run your project from there.
